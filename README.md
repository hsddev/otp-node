I have developed an OTP (One-Time Password) system for user verification, and I would like to propose an idea for its implementation. Please let me know your preference regarding this idea.

Here is the proposed workflow for user registration and verification:

1. When a user hits the register API post request:
   Create a new user account.
   Generate an OTP specifically for the user account that was created.

2. Next, the user will receive the OTP via email.

3. To verify the OTP, the user needs to hit the verification API post request:
   Validate whether the OTP has expired.
   Check if the entered OTP matches the one received by the user.

4. If the verification is successful:
   Update the "flag" attribute in the user model to true, indicating that the user has been verified.
